** Academic **

* Electrolysis?

* Fusor (demo and Tec versions)

* Cansat

* Neutron 1D solver

* MPS gradient descent

* Docker/Linux stuff for neutronics?


** Fabrica/Kilns **

* electric kiln project (ElectricKiln):
- careful with influx credentials!!!
- modify readme
	- differentiate between max31856 version and others
	- solidworks/COMSOL files or images of design
	- physical construction
	- web server config, captive portal, influx+grafana
	- control box design and construction
	- ads thermocouple implementation
- add PCBs
	- include remark of the modifications of relay driver and ads TC card
- maybe some marketing on forums/youtube ?

* Gas kiln ESP32 (HornoGas / espnows)
HornoGas: esp32 control system using espnow network
- add readme (spaghetti code! mention better newer version)
	- use readme from Arduino folder to list features 
	- ie Grafana, influx, espnow
	- burner analysis w/ python and matlab (ML)
- add PCB if possible
espnow:
- add repository, probably only of espnow dpt west or all?
- add readme
- add PCB if possible

* chimney actuator
- create detailed readme
- for readme use ppt
- add PCB
- add solidworks and parts
- mention Gil and Ricardo

* Modbus ESP32 Gas Kiln controller (Gas-Kiln-Controller / TFT-Horno-Gas)
- 2 repositories is necessary (yes?)
- add readme (TFT) and modify readme (horno-gas)
	- mention platformio, simulation mode
	- dpt infrastructure as well
- add PCBs
- explain dpt and influx, careful with credentials??

* Beckhoff PLC Gas Kiln Controller (DemoHorno)
- change name
- add readme
	- recipe handler
	- ads communication with esp32 for influx stack
	- Grafana alarm system with oncall
	- siemens LME burner safety
	- Belimo 4-20mA modulation control
- explain esp32 ads comm and add code (or different repo?)

* Cabinet design and construction
- show different versions of gas kiln cabinet
- show electric kiln cabinet?


* Otras cosas de la fabrica:
- Mixers, lightning, product design

** CNSI **

* Water heater controller
* web server for PID tuning
* Beckhoff DAQ + other sources -> python pandas script excel workbook generator
* Current implementation for new loops via TwinCAT HMI and TwinCAT Measurement


** Hobbies **

* La M: 
- jewelry studio
- vacuum casting machine
- successful resin casting
